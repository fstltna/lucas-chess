It calculates moves but does not include a chessboard. The Komodo web site recommends a few &#39;chessboard&#39; programs (aka GUI) which can be used with Komodo, some of them are open source and of very high quality (</span><span class="c7 c1"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://komodochess.com/installation.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1463851249002000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_3C4mUhJG7gTwQH9K5DYkDLl2Xg">http://komodochess.com/installation.htm</a></span><span class="c1">). For best play it is very important to set the Threads value to match your system. If you do not already own a good UCI-compliant GUI (such as Fritz, Chessbase, Hiarcs Chess Explorer or the Shredder GUI), a good free one for Windows is Arena (</span><span class="c1 c7"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://playwitharena.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1463851249002000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEqD4hXUFfpMiZFiouEC3IVGHLw5g">playwitharena.com</a></span><span class="c1">), version 3.0.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Komodo&#39;s settings can be changed from the GUI. We will explain the non-standard settings below. See setHash.txt for additional information on setting the hash size based on your specific machine and time control.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c18">The most important settings to adjust for your computer are Threads and Hash. They are described below.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Hash</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">----</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This defines the maximum amount of memory to use for the transposition table - a major factor in the performance of modern chess programs. The default is set to 128 (in megabytes) which is probably more than adequate for standard use. &nbsp;However, see the document setHASH.txt for more specific information on how this should be set for ultimate performance. All 64 bit versions allow up to 65536 megabytes (64 GB) to be allocated, assuming your system has that much. The Windows 32 bit version limits this to 2048 megabytes due to hardware and operating system limitations. Please note Komodo&rsquo;s hash entry size is a bit different from other programs. If you allocate 16 megabytes, Komodo will only use 12, and not use any more until you set it to 24, and so on with each doubling. This is normal. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Threads</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For best performance it is very important to correctly set the Threads value. The default is 1. You should set Threads to the number of &quot;real&quot; cores on your machine. Consult your computer manufacturer to determine how many cpu cores your machine has (not to be confused with the number of cpu threads your machine has). We recommend running Komodo with Hyperthreading turned off on your computer. &nbsp;You can often find this in one of the boot up BIOS settings.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">For example, on an i7 with hyperthreading, you typically have 4 &quot;real&quot; cores and 4 hyper-threaded or virtual cores. While the operating system may report 8 cores on this machine, there are only 4 cores and so you set Threads to 4. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Note some GUIs, including ChessBase, change the default to the number of cores reported by the operating system, so you might need to change the default value in such cases. &nbsp;If you find your computer to be sluggish or unresponsive when running Komodo, decrease the Threads value by 1. This will free up a thread for use by the operating system and other programs.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Table Memory</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">------------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This parameter determines how much memory, in megabytes, Komodo will allocate to various internal tables such as the pawn structure hash table, evaluation cache and others. &nbsp;If you allocate too much memory </span><span class="c1 c17">it can negatively impact your performance and if you allocate too little it can also nega</span><span class="c1">tively impact your performance. &nbsp;The default value of 128 is probably close to optimal for fast play on most machines cira 2013 but you may want to experiment with raising this value if you have a high performance machine. For slower games (or analysis) and/or for machines with many cores, higher values are appropriate. We have raised the upper limit in Komodo 9.2 and higher to 1024 megabytes since this may be appropriate for TCEC or similar use with many cores and long time limits. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Use LMR</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">LMR (Late Move Reductions) is a search technique that is designed to aggressively prune moves from the search tree, so deeper depths can be obtained. However this can sometimes miss important moves. &nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c15">LMR can be turned &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;. In general Komodo will play much stronger with LMR turned &quot;on&quot;, but one might want to experiment with turning it off to try a much shallower, but more thorough, search in some positions. With LMR &quot;on&quot; you can make further adjustments using the parameter Reduction described below.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Null Move Pruning</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-----------------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Like LMR, this is also a technique to aggressively prune moves from the search tree. &nbsp;Komodo plays much stronger with Null MOve Pruning turned ON, but occasionally things can be missed, especially very deep threats and zugzwang positions. &nbsp;This option allows you to experiment in the case that you have a difficult position which cannot be resolved and want to see if a much shallower, but more thorough, search would help.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Overhead ms</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-----------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is designed to compensate for slow user interfaces or slow internet connections, where a fraction of a second can be lost in the processing and transferring of information back and forth from the engine to the interface. &nbsp;The value is in milliseconds (1/1000th of a second). &nbsp;This should probably be left alone unless you see the program starting to forfeit games due to exhausting its time. If you see such time forfeits, increase this value. The default is 30. For internet play where lag is an issue a value of 60 is a good first try, but may have to go to 100 or even higher.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Contempt (Komodo 9.2 and higher)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">--------------------------------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A positive Contempt is used by the computer&rsquo;s evaluation to discourage or encourage piece trades and draws early in the game. The default value is 10 (in version 9.3 and higher) which should help against weaker opponents. Against near-equal opponents, set Contempt to zero for best results. Against a human opponent, Contempt should be at least 25 even if he is the World Champion. Suggested values include 50 against grandmasters, 75 against masters, and 100 against strong amateurs. A good rule of thumb is to subtract the opponent&#39;s Elo rating from 3400 (estimated rating of Komodo 10 on a quadcore machine) and divide by 15. Higher Contempt values are especially appropriate when Komodo is giving a handicap. For handicap play, a good rule of thumb is to set Contempt for one third of the value of the initial position based on a one minute search in infinite analysis mode. For example, if giving knight odds, if an initial one minute analysis search shows Komodo as down by 3.5 pawns, set Contempt to 117, which is 117 centipawns, or a third of the disadvantage. Contempt works with the next option &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo;. In analysis mode, Komodo internally sets Contempt to zero unless &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; is turned on.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">White Contempt</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">--------------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; se</span><span class="c1">tting forces Komodo to always use the Contempt value above from White&rsquo;s point of view, instead of from whatever side Komodo is searching or analyzing, and also uses COntempt min infinite or analysis mode. If you are playing tournaments with multiple games, this should be turned off since &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; &ldquo;locks&rdquo; Contempt to one color instead of for the side Komodo is currently searching. A positive value will discourage Komodo playing for White from accepting a draw or trading pieces. A negative Contempt value will encourage Komodo playing for White to trade pieces and seek a draw. &nbsp;For Black, a reversed sign should be used (for example, a negative value like -10 will discourage Black from exchanging pieces, and a positive value like 10 will encourage Black to seek a draw). </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; also prevents Komodo from automatically setting Contempt to zero when running infinite analysis. This helps make anal</span><span class="c1">ysis consistent when switching sides and exploring various lines and lets you include a non-zero Contempt in your analysis. Note when playing against the computer, and you wish to use a non-zero Contempt, &nbsp;either turn off &ldquo;White Contempt&rdquo; so that Contempt will apply to the Computer&rsquo;s side, or you can use the above description to set an appropriate Contempt for the specific side that Komodo is playing.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Note that Contempt modifies the reported scores. On average a setting of 10 will increase the score for that side by ten centipawns (0.1 in most GUIs), more in the opening and less in the endgame. Contempt is turned off in Infinite analysis unless &ldquo;White COntempt&rdquo; (described below) is used.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Time Usage</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">----------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This provides the ability to manipulate Komodo&#39;s time control heuristics, to make it allocate time more quickly or less quickly. &nbsp;The default is 0 which is what we believe is the ideal setting but remains to be tested. &nbsp;You can make it play faster by using a negative number or you can make it allocate time more aggressively by setting it to a positive value. &nbsp;The range of values is between -9 and +9. &nbsp;It&#39;s very unlikely extreme values will be play well, so we suggest experimenting with relatively modest changes to the default. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tablebase (Syzygy) support</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">--------------------------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Komodo supports Ronald de Man&#39;s &#39;Syzygy&#39; endgame tablebases. Endgame tablebases can be used to provide absolute knowledge about chess positions in which only a few pieces are left on the board (at the time of this writing, the Syzygy bases support up to 6-man positions, including the kings). Adding Syzygy to your computer and Komodo can increase the playing strength.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Syzygy tablebases are &quot;Distance to Zero&quot; (DTZ) tablebases. This means that they report, in addition to a definitive win/draw/loss (WDL) score, the distance to the zeroing of the 50-move draw clock. Unlike other endgame tablebases which report Distance to Mate (DTM), the Syzygy bases won&#39;t always report the fastest win from a particular endgame position, but you can be confident that the WDL score (and moves) provided by a tablebase probe are accurate.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">How to get the Syzygy tablebases: at the moment, the best way to get the required files is via the file-sharing service BitTorrent (on OSX, Transmission is a good client, on Windows and Linux, Vuze). &nbsp;The necessary .torrent files can be found at http://oics.olympuschess.com/tracker/index.php. You should get at least the 3-4-5-man set (approx. 2 GB). The 6-man set is an additional approx. 138 GB large and will take a while to download. The 3-4-5-man set is also available for direct download from:</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">http://chess.cygnitec.com/tablebases/syzygy/.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Installing the Syzygy tablebases: create a folder on your computer&#39;s hard drive and place the fully-downloaded .rtbw (WDL files) and .rtbz (DTZ files) in it. If you have an SSD drive, we recommend that you place the WDL files in a folder on that drive, especially if you are using the 6-man bases.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Understanding the Syzygy tablebase output: if the number of pieces on the board is less than or equal to the &#39;Syzygy Probe Limit&#39; [see below] or the number of pieces supported by your installation of the Syzygy bases, whichever is less, Komodo will report a score which can be interpreted as a win, draw or loss.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A score of +/- #1000 indicates a tablebase win or loss for a root tablebase position, that is, for a 6-man position with 6-man tablebases installed. For tablebase wins or losses which are determined during search, for instance for a 6-man position with 5-man tablebases installed, Komodo will return +/- 250.00 respectively. Komodo will attempt to resolve these scores to actual mate scores, although this may take a long time. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Finally, a score of 0.00 or +/- 0.02 indicates a draw (+/- 0.02 is a draw which would be a win/loss if the 50-move rule were not in effect).</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Syzygy tablebase options: Komodo has a number of UCI options to control its use of the tablebases.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Use Syzygy: when on (default), Komodo will try to use the Syzygy tablebases specified in the &#39;SyzygyPath&#39; option (see below). When off, Komodo will not attempt to load the bases.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">SyzygyPath: this defines an absolute path on your computer to the tablebase files. On Windows, multiple paths can be separated with a semicolon (;) character. On OSX and Linux, multiple paths should be separated with the colon (:) character. For instance,</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">on Windows</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;C:/Tablebases/Syzygy&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;C:/Tablebases/Syzygy;D:/SyzygyWDL&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">on OSX and Linux</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;/home/me/syzygy&quot; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;/home/me/syzygy:/media/ssd/wdl&quot;</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Syzygy Probe Depth: this determines the depth at which tablebases will be probed during search (note that the root position will always be probed. &nbsp;If &#39;Use Syzygy&#39; is enabled and the number of pieces on the board is less than or equal to the &#39;Syzygy Probe Limit&#39; [see below] or the number of pieces supported by your installation of the Syzygy bases, whichever is less). &nbsp;A higher number means that Komodo will wait longer to begin probing the tablebases for any particular search. &nbsp;The default depth is 2 half-plies.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Syzygy Probe Limit: this determines how many pieces need to be on the board before Komodo begins probing (even at the root). &nbsp;By default, this is set to 6 (the current upper limit of the Syzygy tablebases). Of course, if you have only the 3-4-5-man set, Komodo will only begin probing the bases when a 5-man position arises. Note 6 piece use can take up both a lot of drive storage, but RAM during the search.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Syzygy 50 Move Rule: when on (default), Komodo will respect the 50-move rule in its tablebase evaluation (a won position which requires more than 50 moves without a pawn move or capture to win will be scored as a draw). &nbsp;When off, Komodo will ignore the 50-move rule in its evaluation (the same position would receive a winning score).</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Selectivity</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-----------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You can adjust how aggressively Komodo prunes using the &quot;Selectivity&quot; parameter. &nbsp;Higher values will encourage Komodo to prune more at low search depths, leading to a deeper overall search at an increasing risk of missing some moves. &nbsp;The default in Komodo 10 is 131. A setting of 246 (or more) will set selectivity to the maximum. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reduction</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This controls how deeply Komodo searches. &nbsp;Higher &quot;Reduction&quot; values will cause Komodo to reduce parts of the tree more, increasing overall search depth but possibly missing some good lines. &nbsp;The default is 0, meaning no adjustment to what we consider best. We are fairly confident that the best value on a single thread is close to zero, but we have not yet determined whether other values may be better on many threads, so feel free to experiment. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">King Safety</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-----------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This controls how highly Komodo scores king safety. &nbsp;The higher the value, the greater the effects of attacks on the king in Komodo&#39;s evaluation. &nbsp;The default is 65 in Komodo 10.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Persistent Hash</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">---------------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is useful for long analysis. &nbsp;It allows you to save the current Hash Table to your hard drive, then reload it later. &nbsp;First, set a name for the file in the &quot;Hash File Name&quot; option. Most GUIs will require you to close the dialog box with an OK to &ldquo;set&rdquo; the name. You should then stop the search/analysis, return to the UCI parameters then, then click the &quot;Save Hash to File&quot; button. &nbsp;To later reload the saved information, first make sure the &quot;Hash File Name&quot; is for the file you want, then click &quot;Load Hash from File&quot;. &nbsp;Once it loads, you may continue analysis. &nbsp;You must make sure the current hash filename is the same as what was used when you saved the file. &nbsp;Note that hash files can be very large and can take a lot of time to save and load, so make sure you have enough disk space to use them.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Suppress</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">--------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This feature allows you to reduce the data Komodo outputs for the first X ply of a search.

<p class="c2"><span class="c1">--------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Introduced in Komodo 9.4, Dynamism lets you control how important Komodo thinks the dynamic part of the evaluation is. The default is 110. &nbsp;Values under 110 reduce the dynamic evaluation, while values above 110 increase the dynamic evaluation. &nbsp;Lower values will make Komodo play more conservatively,while with higher values it will play riskier moves. More static parts of the evaluation like material and pawn structure are not changed by Dynamism. Although the parameter can be set from 0 to 200, single-digit values will cause bizarre play. 
  A value around 80 will in general produce more realistic evaluations than the default 110, although it will weaken play by 20 to 30 Elo points.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Magnify</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">--------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Magnify allows you to increase or decrease the entire evaluation from Komodo. This lets you tune it to fit specific GUIs which give good/bad move symbols, and adjust the score to your liking. Magnify will not change mate scores. The default for Magnify is 88. Higher values will expand the score, and lower value compress the score. Changing the value also affect pruning decisions by Komodo. A large change will weaken it substantially. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Opening Books</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-------------</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Komodo can use Polyglot opening books.

Also, make sure the OwnBook UCI option is checked, and that &quot;Book File&quot; is also set to komodo.bin. The option &ldquo;Best Book Line&rdquo; when set will make Komodo play the best scoring book move, or randomly select between two or more book moves with the same score. When off, it will tend to play the best scoring move more often, but still give the weaker moves some play. &nbsp;Komodo 9.4 better handles opening books modified using the free scid program (</span><span class="c7 c1"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sourceforge.net/projects/scid/files/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1463851249035000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFnTeH2_VCOwi4HC8Qp956jNUfgFw">https://sourceforge.net/projects/scid/files/</a></span><span class="c1">).</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><h2 class="c2 c9" id="h.wee9w41n6lrq"><span>Credits</span></h2><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Authors: Larry Kaufman, Don Dailey and Mark Lefler.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We wish to thank Jeremy Bernstein for his fine work in adding Syzygy tablebase support to Komodo.
